# Android Redirect

This project demonstrates how to create a URL redirect that attempts to open the Android Settings app.

## How It Works

- When you open the link below, it will try to redirect you to the Android Settings app via an `intent://` URL.

- If the redirect fails, it will display a clickable link for manual redirection.

## Try It Out
